# DQNCartpole

My first successful Deep RL agent! Simply run Training.py and it will train a QNet (the classes and functions for which are in Agent.py) for 3000 episodes. Every episode of training, the program will print the episode its on, the score achieved that episode, and a "running score" that keeps track of recent progress. In addition, every 100 episodes, starting with the first, the program will render the cartpole environment so you can see the progress the agent is making over time.
